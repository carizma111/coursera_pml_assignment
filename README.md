The repo contains four items -

## a. project_assignment.Rmd
The .RMD document examines data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to predict the manner in which these participants exercise. The document describes how the model was built, how was the cross validation used, how was accuracy determined and why some choices were made. Finally, the trained model was used to predict 20 different test cases.
